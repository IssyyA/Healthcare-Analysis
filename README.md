## Dataset Description
The data model comprises five tables capturing patient admissions, billing records, and demographic information from various hospitals and insurance providers, designed in a star schema. This structure efficiently supports the analysis of key performance indicators over the specified period.

### Tables
* Fact Hospital: The central fact table containing granular details of each patient admission, including Billing Amount, Date of Admission, Discharge Date, Doctor, Length of Stay, and linking keys to other dimensions. This table also includes Hospital Latitude and Hospital Longitude for geographic analysis, and Patient ID for unique patient tracking.
* Dim Patient: A dimension table providing detailed patient demographics and admission characteristics such as Admission Type, Age, Age Bands, Blood Type, Condition, Gender, and Insurance Provider.
* Dim Hospital: A dimension table containing unique Hospital names and additional hospital-specific attributes.
* Dim Medication: A dimension table listing distinct Medication types prescribed during admissions.
* DateTable: A standard date dimension table used for time-based filtering and analysis, including Date, Day, DayNumber, Month, and Month sh (shorthand month name).

### Calculated Measures
* Total Patients: Count of unique patient admissions (derived from Patient ID in Fact Hospital).
* Total Billing Amount: Sum of all Billing amount from Fact Hospital.
* Avg Length of Stay: Average of Length of Stay from Fact Hospital.
* Most Common Condition: Dynamically identifies the most frequent Condition from Dim Patient.
* % YoY Growth: Year-over-Year percentage change for Total Patients and Total Billing.
* DAX Measures: Pre-calculated KPIs for breakdowns by gender, age, state, condition, and provider, utilizing fields from the various dimension tables linked to Fact Hospital.

While the average length of stay remained stable, key insights emerged regarding the prevalence of chronic conditions, financial contributions of major providers and insurers, and demographic patterns.

*   A total of **55,500 patients** were served, generating **$1.42 billion** in total billing, both showing a healthy **7% Year-over-Year (YoY)** increase.
*   The **average length of stay** remained consistent at **15.51 days**.
*   **Hypertension** was identified as the **most common medical condition**.
*   Patient admissions showed a clear **quarterly trend**, typically peaking in **Q3**.
*   **Houston Hospital** and **Johns Hopkins** consistently managed the highest patient volumes and billing amounts.

### Insights Deep Dive

**Category 1: Patient Volume & Demographics**
*   **Total Patient Volume:** The dashboard tracked 55,500 patient admissions over the period, demonstrating a 7% YoY increase, indicating expanding service reach or rising healthcare demand.
*   **Gender Distribution:** Admissions were largely balanced, with Males accounting for 50%, Females 40%, and a notable 10% identifying as Non-binary, highlighting the importance of inclusive data capture.
*   **Age Groups:** The 20-29 age bracket consistently showed the highest patient volume (e.g., 1,545 patients in 2021 as seen in the Demographics tab), suggesting a high engagement of young adults with the healthcare system, potentially for acute conditions or initial diagnoses.
*   **Geographic Reach:** Analysis by state reveals higher patient densities in states like California, Texas, and Florida (indicated by darker shading on the map), suggesting a concentration of services or higher population healthcare needs in these regions.
*   **Quarterly Trends:** Admitted patients showed a clear seasonal trend, with volumes typically increasing from Q1 to a peak in Q3 (e.g., 14.19K in Q3) before a slight decline in Q4. This pattern could inform staffing and resource planning.
